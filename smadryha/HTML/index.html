        <h2><a id="article1">  What is HTML? </a></h2>
    </header>
    <p style="font-size: larger;"> HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.
         The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. 
         For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design. HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989.
          It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. 
         Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.
A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.They work together but perform different functions – it is worth investing 2 minutes in differentiating the two.
Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.Now that we’ve gotten the basic theory out of the way. It’s time to learn how to build our first website.
</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;"> First off, we must ensure that we have the right tools. Most important, we need an HTML editor.There are many choices on the market.
Well, it depends on what you want from it. Knowing HTML will take only a few days of reading and learning the codes for what you want. You can have the basics down in an hour. Once you know the tags you can create HTML pages.
However, using HTML and designing good websites is a different story, which is why I try to do more than just teach you code here at HTML Source — I like to add in as much advice as possible too. Good website design is half skill and half talent, I reckon.
 Learning techniques and correct use of your tag knowledge will improve your work immensely, and a good understanding of general design and the audience you’re trying to reach will improve your website’s chances of success.
 Luckily, these things can be researched and understood, as long as you’re willing to work at it so you can output better websites. The range of skills you will learn as a result of running your own website is impressive. You’ll learn about aspects of graphic design, typography and computer programming. 
 Your efficiency with computers in general increases. You’ll also learn about promotion and your writing will probably improve too, as you adapt to write for certain audiences. You can code your entire website offline, storing it all on your own computer, and then just transfer all the files onto the web. 
 Then whenever you have new content, you just add that to the existing online version of your site. It’s really quite simple.Of course, but since making websites became more popular and needs increased many other supporting languages have been created to allow new stuff to happen, plus HTML is modified every few years to make way for improvements.
Cascading Stylesheets are used to control how your pages are presented, and make pages more accessible. Basic special effects and interaction is provided by JavaScript, which adds a lot of power to basic HTML. 
 Most of this advanced stuff is for later down the road, but when using all of these technologies together, you have a lot of power at your disposal.

        <h2> <a id="article2"> The History of HTML</a></h2>
     </header>
     <p style="font-size:larger;">
        HTML is an evolving language. It doesn’t stay the same for long before a revised set of standards and specifications are brought in to allow easier creation of prettier and more efficient sites. 
        Let’s start at the beginning...
     </p>
<p style="font-size: larger;"> HTML 1.0 was the first release of HTML to the world. Not many people were involved in website creation at the time, and the language was very limiting. 
    There really wasn’t much you could do with it bar getting some simple text onto the web. But then, just that got the beardos a-foamin’ back in the day. HTML 2.0 included everything from the original 1.0 specifications but added a few new features to the mix. 
    » HTML 2.0 was the standard for website design until January 1997 and defined many core HTML features for the first time.
    More and more people were getting into the HTML game around now, and while the previous standards offered some decent abilities to webmasters (as they became known), they thirsted for more abilities and tags. They wanted to enhance the look of their sites.

    This is where trouble started. A company called Netscape was the clear leader in the browser market at the time, with a browser called Netscape Navigator. To appease the cries of the HTML authors, they introduced new proprietary tags and attributes into their Netscape Navigator browser. 
    These new abilities were called Netscape extension tags. This caused big problems as other browsers tried to replicate the effects of these tags so as not to be left behind but could not get their browsers to display things the same way. 
    This meant that if you designed a page with Netscape ETs, the page would look bad in other browsers. This caused confusion and irritation for the markup pioneers.
    At this time, a HTML working group, led by a man named Dave Raggett introduced a new HTML draft, HTML 3.0. It included many new and improved abilities for HTML, and promised far more powerful opportunities for webmasters to design their pages. Sadly, the browsers were awfully slow in implementing any of the new improvements, only adding in a few and leaving out the rest. Partly, this failure can be attributed to the size of the overhaul; and so the HTML 3.0 spec was abandoned.
Thankfully, the people in charge noted this and so future improvements were always designed to be modular. This meant they could be added in stages, which makes it easier on the browser companies.
</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;">HTML 4.0 was a large evolution of the HTML standards, and the last iteration of classic HTML. Early in development it had the code-name COUGAR. Most of the new functionality brought in this time is from the ill-fated HTML 3.0 spec, as well as a host of trimmings on old tags, a focus on internationalisation, and support for HTML’s new supporting presentational language, cascading stylesheets.

    HTML 4.0 was recommended by the W3C in December ’97 and became the official standard in April 1998. Browser support was undertaken surprisingly earnestly by Microsoft in their Internet Explorer browser, and the market-leading IE5 (and current successor IE6) have excellent support for almost all of the new tags and attributes. 
    In comparison, Netscape’s terribly flawed Navigator 4.7 was inept when it came to HTML 4.0 and even basic CSS. Modern browsers however, are a vast improvement.
    Once HTML 4.0 had been out for a little while, the documentation was revised and corrected in a few minor ways and was entitled HTML 4.01; the final version of the specification.

    Head on over to the W3C site for the  official documentation; and to read more about the new tags, attributes and redundancies brought about by this new standard, read our article, HTML 4 Explained.
</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;"> After HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0, the guys who were in control of HTML’s direction got sidetracked working on a new proposal for XHTML 2. At the same time, clever web developers were innovating constantly, hacking new functionality into websites and browsers. The path that XHTML 2 was taking started to look both boring and unrealistic, and it became pretty clear that a new approach was needed.

    It was around this time that a bunch of pragmatic web technology fans, browser programmers and specification writers started building something of their own, outside of the usual W3C procedures. They called themselves the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), and developed a new spec. After some soul-searching, the W3C decided that HTML was still the future of the web. XHTML 2 was discontinued and HTML5 became the new specification that everyone’s effort should be poured into.HTML5 is designed for the web, both now and in the future. This is the specification that we will be working with for the next decade at least, so the process of its development is relatively slow and considered. Many parts will be familiar, but there’s also plenty of new elements, attributes and abilities to get excited about. You can check the latest version of the spec if you want all the detail. A full tutorial on HTML Source about the changes in HTML5 is forthcoming.

        <h2><a id="article3">Browser Review</a> </h2>
    </header>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Most web designers will have copies of each of the leading browsers installed on their system — for testing purposes — and so can decide themselves which browser they like the best.
         However, given the percentage of readers who come to HTML Source still using Internet Explorer 6, there are obviously a huge amount of people out there who haven’t been told that there are better browsers available.
         First, a little history, for the benefit of those who weren’t around during the infamous “browser wars.” Believe it or not, there was a point, a long time ago, when Netscape Navigator dominated the market. At around version 3 the browser was, for the time, excellent. HTML was simple and relatively pure. 
         Eyeing Netscape’s success in a field that they had previously shown no interest in (Bill Gates himself once dismissed the Internet as a passing fad), Microsoft released their own browser, Internet Explorer (IE), with the sole intention of dislodging Netscape.

         IE quickly became popular. Then came a period of flurried activity, with the two browser manufacturers releasing updates to their browser on ever-decreasing time scales. New HTML tags and DHTML extensions were created and then loosely documented. A designer could use these elements, but at the cost of having them fail in the competitor’s browser. 
         
         A split started to form as pages designed for one of the “big two” browsers would not work in the other.
         <p style="font-size: larger;"> Netscape released Navigator version 4 in 1997. It was a very poor browser, laced with bugs and new abilities that broke backwards-compatibility. What caused most pain among developers was that it happily blundered into advanced CSS and JavaScript code that it should have had the sense to ignore. Microsoft released the superior Internet Explorer 4, and the tide started to turn very quickly.
         Eventually it became obvious that Netscape were fighting a losing battle. Because IE came pre-installed on every Windows machine, most users just used that instead of seeking out alternatives (this is the same problem that plagues any competing browser to this day).
          By the time Internet Explorer 6 was released, its market share had grown to a high of about 95%.
        </p>
          <p style="font-size: larger;"> In the years that followed, lazy or ill-equipped web designers began to design their sites to work only in IE, as making a site look the same in other browsers required a lot of knowledge and effort. This only encouraged users to stick with IE, no matter how many advances were made in other browsers. Even when Netscape belatedly released the vastly improved Navigator 6 in the year 2000, it barely made a dent in the market.
And so, the war ended. Lying in its wake was a web of incompatibilities and sites that only worked in a certain version of one browser. HTML had been blown off course as a structural markup language and was now bloated with presentational elements like the much-maligned font tag. It took years to even begin to undo the damage that had been done.
 
</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;">Happily, things have finally started moving back towards a level playing field. Internet Explorer’s dominancy is no longer absolute, and web surfers now have lots of choice when deciding which browser they should use.</p>
